# QA

## A) Explain this code:

It will schedule an artisan command with the signature "app:example-command" to run every hour. The command will run in background which means that it can run simultaneously with other commands. However, it will not overlap, so if the next command comes along on the next hour and the previous one is still running, a lock will be in place, and the next command will not run. Finally, the command should run on one server only, so the first server to obtain the task will implement an atomic lock to prevent other servers from running it.

## B) What is the difference between the Context and Cache Facades? Provide examples to illustrate your explanation.

The Cache facade provides access to Laravel's caching system, used to avoid unnecessary database
trips or expensive computations, for example:

```
$value = Cache::get('heavy_computation');

if (!$value) {
$value = $someHeavyComputation;

Cache::put('heavy_computation', $value, 600); // 10 minutes
}
```

On the code above, instead of doing the heavy computation every time the script is called, we store it for 10 minutes.

The Context facade also deals with data, but it's about information rather than performance. It allows you to add additional information to logs, jobs or other classes where it might make sense to retrieve it. For instance I can add context information about the IP who is making the HTTP request:

```
Context::add('ip', $request->ip());
```

And that information will be added to any subsequent logs and jobs, and also be able to be retrieved to, for instance, change something somewhere else on the application based on the IP's country. The Context data is something more informational and dealt with within the lifecycle of the request, different from what happens with the Cache facade, which is a long-lived data used for performance reasons.

## C) What's the difference between $query->update(), $model->update(), and $model->updateQuietly() in Laravel, and when would you use each?

`$query->update()`, assuming from the variable name, updates records directly in the database, so it won't trigger any model events. `$query` of course, might be a Model, so it would behave as `$model->update()` does, which updates a single model instance and the database records associated with it, while firing all model events. Finally, `$model->updateQuietly()` also updates a single model and the database records associated with it, but without firing any model events (hence the quietly).

Use `$query->update()` when doing bulk updates, and no model events are needed; `$model->update()` when updating a single model and you want to fire model events; and `$model->updateQuietly()` when updating a single model and you _don't_ want to trigger model events.
